# Volatility Study Repository

This repository contains a study of the volatility of four different assets.
The main focus is to identify the properties of the time series and fit a GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) model using Python in a Jupyter Notebook.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Git should be installed on your local machine.
- Python and Jupyter Notebook should be installed.
  
### Steps
  1. Clone the repository on your local machine. 
  2. Create a new branch called dev_{your name}
  3. Open the Jupyter Notebook file to start working on the project.
  4. Complete the exercise by following the instructions provided in the Jupyter Notebook file.
  5. Push your changes to your branch.

## About the Project
This project aims to analyze the volatility of four assets using statistical models, particularly the GARCH model, implemented in a Jupyter Notebook. It includes data preprocessing, model fitting, and analysis, all done in Python.

## Project Structure
- data_challenge.pkl/: Contains the datasets for the assets.
- challenge.ipynb/: Includes the Jupyter Notebook file for the volatility study.

## Guidelines
- You are free to access any source on the internet but the use of Chat GPT 
- Ensure your code is well-documented and follows Python coding conventions.
- Include detailed comments in your code to explain the logic and any assumptions made.
- Provide clear and concise commit messages.
- Use of ChatGPT or similar tools to generate code is strictly forbidden.
- If you encounter any issues or have suggestions, feel free to ask directly to the interviewer. 

Thank you for contributing to the volatility study project! Let's enhance our understanding of market dynamics together.
